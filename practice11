The Apache Web server is started by a command when the Web server boots up. But the user who starts Apache is often 
a restricted and unprivileged user, such as nobody or apache or www-data. 
This is for security reasons, to prevent someone from hacking into the website and then gaining control of the whole server.
You can find out who that user is by running the command below and looking in the first column. 
The ps aux command shows all of the processes running on the server, and grep shows only processes that contain the word “apache.”

ps aux | grep apache

*.apache.*
