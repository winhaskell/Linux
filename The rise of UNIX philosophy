The rise of UNIX philosophy

Ken Thomson and the developers of UNIX established a set of cultural norms for developing software popularly 
known as the “UNIX philosophy.”  It emphasizes building simple, modular, and extensible software that can be
easily maintained. The UNIX philosophy is summarized as follows:

Small is beautiful.
Make each program do one thing well.
To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new “features”.
Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
Build a prototype as soon as possible.
Choose portability over efficiency.
