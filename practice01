1.
Let's continue with more commands. In the terminal, print the working directory.

$ ls
2014  2015  hardware.txt


2.
List all files and directories in the working directory.

$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog



$ cd ..
To move up one directory, use cd ... Here, cd .. navigates up from jan/memory/ to jan/.

Make sure you are in the directory /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2018/jan by using the command pwd.

Instructions
1.
Once you are in /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2018/jan, change the directory to the 2018/feb/ directory using:

cd ../feb
List all files and directories in the working directory.

Type pwd into the terminal to see where you are.

If you are in /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/, then enter the command cd 2018 followed by: cd jan before moving on to the checkpoints.

2.
Type:

mkdir media
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new directory named media/.


$ mkdir foo
$ cd foo
$ mkdir bar

cd ..
回到目录路径的上一级路径

Once you are in /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2018/jan, change the directory to the 2018/feb/ directory using:

cd ../feb
/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2018/feb/


Type:

mkdir media
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new directory named media/.


mkdir
$ mkdir media
The mkdir command stands for "make directory". It takes in a directory name as an argument, 
and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.

Here we used mkdir to create a new directory named media/ inside the feb/ directory.

Instructions
1.
Navigate to the 2018/dec/ directory using cd.

List all files and directories in the working directory to see what is in there currently.

2.
Then type:

touch keyboard.txt
Again, list all files and directories in the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new file named keyboard.txt.


touch
touch keyboard.txt
The touch command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.

Here we used touch to create a new file named keyboard.txt inside the 2018/dec/ directory.


NAVIGATION
Generalizations
Congratulations! You've learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.
ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.
cd switches you into the directory you specify.
mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.
touch creates a new file inside the working directory.
