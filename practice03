LEARN THE COMMAND LINE

Athletica
In this project, you'll use the commands you just learned to redirect files in Athletica, a sporting events directory.

If you get stuck during this project, check out the project walkthrough video which can be found at the bottom of the page after 
the final step of the project.

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off

1.
Print the working directory.

pwd

2.
List all files and directories in long format, including hidden files.

ls -la

3.
Use cat to view the contents of basketball.txt.

cat basketball.txt

4.
Use cat to view the contents of hockey.txt.

cat hockey.txt

5.
Redirect the standard output of basketball.txt into hockey.txt. Then view the contents of hockey.txt.

cat basketball.txt > hockey.txt
cat hockey.txt

6.
View the contents of lacrosse.txt.

cat lacrosse.txt

7.
Append the contents of lacrosse.txt to the contents of tennis.txt. Then, view the contents of tennis.txt.

cat lacrosse.txt >> tennis.txt
cat tennis.txt

8.
Redirect the contents of gymnastics.txt as standard input for the cat command.

cat < gymnastics.txt

9.
Pipe the standard output of cat lacrosse.txt to the wordcount command.

cat lacrosse.txt | wc

10.
Use cat to view the contents of equipment.txt.

cat equipment.txt

11.
Sort the contents of equipment.txt in alphabetical order.

sort equipment.txt

12.
Use the uniq command to filter out adjacent, duplicate lines in equipment.txt.

sort equipment.txt | uniq

13.
Use the grep command to search roster.txt for players from Japan.

grep Japan roster.txt

14.
Use the grep command to search for the string 'player' in the current directory (.), and output filenames and lines for matched results.

grep -R player .

15.
Use cat to view the contents of games.txt. Then, use sed to replace all instances of the word 'loss' with 'win' in games.txt.

sed 's/loss/win/' games.txt



grep II
$ grep -R Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -R searches all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing matched results. -R stands for "recursive". Here grep -R searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string "Arctic" and outputs filenames and lines with matched results.

$ grep -Rl Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
grep -Rl searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results. -R stands for "recursive" and l stands for "files with matches". Here grep -Rl searches the /home/ccuser/workspace/geography directory for the string "Arctic" and outputs filenames with matched results.

Instructions
1.
Use cat to display the contents of forests.txt

2.
In the terminal, type

sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt
3.
Now type

sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt


What command searches all files recursively for Gambino?
grep -R Gambino .


grep I
$ grep Mount mountains.txt
grep stands for "global regular expression print". It searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results. It is also case sensitive. Here, grep searches for "Mount" in mountains.txt.

$ grep -i Mount mountains.txt
grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searches for capital or lowercase strings that match Mount in mountains.txt.

The above commands are a great way to get started with grep. If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can use regular expressions to search for patterns in files.

Instructions
1.
grep can also be used to search within a directory. In the terminal, type

grep -R Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography
2.
Then type

grep -Rl Arctic /home/ccuser/workspace/geography




sed
$ sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt
sed stands for "stream editor". 
It accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression, before displaying it as output data. 
It is similar to "find and replace".

Let's look at the expression 's/snow/rain/':

s: stands for "substitution". it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.
In this case, sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" and replaces it with "rain." 
Importantly, the above command will only replace the first instance of "snow" on a line.

$ sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt
The above command uses the g expression, meaning "global". Here sed searches forests.txt for the word "snow" and
replaces it with "rain", globally. All instances of "snow" on a line will be turned to "rain".



sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.
