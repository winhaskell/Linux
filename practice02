1.
Print the working directory.

If you ever get lost, you can return to this directory using cd.

$ pwd
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii
Return here by entering:

$ cd /home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii

2.
List the files and directories in the working directory.

$ ls
brands.txt  freight  mountain  racing

3.
Change directories to the freight/ directory.

$ cd freight

$ cd porteur

6.
Change directories up two levels to the bicycle-world-ii/ directory.

List the files and directories in the bicycle-world-ii/ directory.

$ cd ../..
$ ls
brands.txt  freight  mountain  racing
If you see an error like No such file or directory, you might be in the wrong directory! Use cd ../.. from within porteur/.

7.
Change directories to the mountain/downhill/ directory.

$ cd mountain/downhill

8.
Make a file called dirt.txt.

$ touch dirt.txt

9.
Make a file called mud.txt.

Generalizations
Congratulations! You've learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use the terminal.
A filesystem organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.
From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

pwd 
outputs the name of the current working directory.

ls 
lists all files and directories in the working directory.

cd 
switches you into the directory you specify.

mkdir 
creates a new directory in the working directory.

touch 
creates a new file inside the working directory.
